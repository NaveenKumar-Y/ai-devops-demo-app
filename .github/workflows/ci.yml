Here is an example of a GitHub Actions pipeline for a Python application:

```yml
name: Build and Deploy to Docker Hub

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

      - name: Build Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v3
        with:
          context: .  # change this to the path of your repository
          tags: ${{ github.event.tags }}
          push: true

      - name: Tag and push to Docker Hub
        run: |
          docker tag ${GITHUB_TOKEN}your-repo-name:latest
          docker push ${GITHUB_TOKEN}your-repo-name:latest
```

Let me explain what each step does:

1. `Checkout code` checks out the code from your repository using GitHub Actions.

2. `Install dependencies` installs all the dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file into a virtual environment created by Python 3.9. The `no-cache-dir` argument prevents pip from caching packages.

3. `Build Docker image` builds an image for your application with the tag specified in the `tags` field of the GitHub Actions workflow. You can specify the base image as well by using the `context` parameter. In this case, we're building a Docker image from your repository.

4. `Tag and push to Docker Hub` tags the latest image and pushes it to Docker Hub. The tag name should match the one specified in the workflow.
